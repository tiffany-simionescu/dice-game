# Welcome to the Dice Game

This is a Dice Game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The onclick function for the Let's Roll button creates two random numbers between 1 and 6. After evaluating the random number values with conditionals, the winner is displayed in the heading, and the scoreboard is updated accordingly. There's also a reset button to clear the scoreboard.
